        <h2>FBAUL — Job Platform Re-design</h2>

        <p class="text-understate">UX/UI Design</p>

        <p>The scope of this project was to rejunate the unkown job platform offered by the Faculty of Fine Arts of the University of Lisbon. We decide to tackle this problematic, since we felt it in our skin as students and possible alumnis. Our solution was simple and objective as we decided to re-design plus implement a better plataform according to the needs of each user.</p>
