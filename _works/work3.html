        <h2>Eatsafe - Food scan app</h2>

        <p class="text-understate">UX/UI Design</p>

        <p>Eatsafe arises as the unique food scan app powered by Champalimaud Foundation.
        The major goal with this project was to reduce the number of allergy reactions while offering the opportunity for the user to create a profile with every food allergy and scan the dish in advance.
