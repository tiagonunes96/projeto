        <p>I'm a passionate self-taught UX/UI Designer &amp; Action Sports Photographer from Madeira Island but currently based in Lisbon.
            Over the last three years I was doing a bachelor in Communication Design at the Faculty of Fine-Arts of the University of Lisbon learning more about design and his real meaning. Nowadays with the constant technology evolution I decided to do a Postgraduate course in Digital Experience Desing in order to learn plus improve my knowledge about User Experience &amp; User Interface.</p>
